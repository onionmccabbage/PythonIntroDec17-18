========
(Feel free to build a class for your OWN data)
Write a class to encapsulate a weather report for a location 
You can decide on any properties you like, but location, temperature and description would be good
Validate location (non-empty string) temperature (int or float) and description (non-empty string)
Decide what to do about invalid values (e.g. raise and exception or use a default)

Exercise the code by making several instances of the weather class (for a few locations)
e.g. Dublin, cloudy, 14 degrees   Letterkenny, sunny, 17 degrees

Add a method to the class which returns a nicely formatted weather report for that location
(i.e. write a __str__ method)

There will be an oportunity to show what you have built

- You may choose to use several modules (with import)
- You might need try-except (especially for file handling)
- Alter these instructions to suit your own ideas

Optional
========
Find a way to validate location as a string of 2 or more characters
Write the data for each of your weather reports to a text file (append each new weather report)
(easiest to print to a file, so the __str__ makes it look nice)
Also find a way to read back and nicely display the weather reports from this file

When you have a number of weather-reports, use filter to show only the warmer places
